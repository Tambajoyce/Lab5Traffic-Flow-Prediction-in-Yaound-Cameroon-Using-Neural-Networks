 Traffic Flow Prediction in Yaoundé, Cameroon Using Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict traffic congestion levels in Yaoundé, Cameroon, using historical traffic data, weather conditions, and time-related features. By leveraging neural networks, the project focuses on forecasting traffic flow and congestion patterns to support smart city solutions and improve transportation management. The methodology involves handling sequential data and multi-variable forecasting to achieve accurate predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
1. Historical traffic flow data.
2. Weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, precipitation).
3. Time-related features (e.g., day of the week, time of day).

Ensure that the dataset is preprocessed and formatted for sequential input, suitable for neural network models.

## Objectives

1. To predict traffic congestion levels in Yaoundé, Cameroon, using historical traffic data, weather conditions, and time-related features.
2. To apply neural networks for forecasting traffic flow and congestion patterns, a key aspect of smart city solutions and transportation management.
3. To explore sequential data handling and multi-variable forecasting techniques.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent records.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from time-related data and weather information.
- **Normalization**: Scale the data for optimal neural network performance.

### 2. Model Development
- Use recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as LSTMs or GRUs, to model sequential dependencies in traffic data.
- Experiment with dense and convolutional layers for feature extraction and forecasting.

### 3. Training and Evaluation
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance.

### 4. Deployment and Testing
- Test the model on real-time traffic data to assess generalization capabilities.
- Develop visualizations to showcase predicted vs. actual traffic flows.

## Expected Outcomes

1. A neural network model capable of predicting traffic congestion levels with high accuracy.
2. Insights into traffic patterns based on historical, weather, and time-related features.
3. Recommendations for improving transportation management in Yaoundé.
